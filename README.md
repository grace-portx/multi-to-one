# YAML Parsers
This is a collection of the parsers developed for managing large YAML files:

**multi-to-sep**

This parser processes multiple YAML files and separates them into individual files.

**multi-sep-no-refs**

This parser also processes multiple YAML files but additionally dereferences each reference before separating the files.
