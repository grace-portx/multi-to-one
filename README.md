# Parsers

This is a collection of the parsers I created to help manage the large YAML files.

multi-to-sep: This is a parser to parse multiple YAML files all to separate individual files.

multi-sep-no-refs: This is a parser that parses multiple YAML files and separates them, while also dereferencing each reference.
